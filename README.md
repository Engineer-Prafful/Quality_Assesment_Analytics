# Quality_Assesment_Analytics
Used Python libraries and Statistical approach to accomplish the task

 The primary object here is to assess the production lines and keep them in check over the time to meet the industrial standards. The organisation keeps track of every move of the production lines for instance, the timings, quantity of beverages, etc.

<br>
<p>In our analysis, we have witnessed that assembly line B has higher chances of introducing latency in filling the bottles as compared to assembly line A. This definitely has a negative impact on our overall production as it slows down the production rate and therefore can affect the final shipment.</p>
<p>The recommendation over here is to investigate the root cause asap. This may include fixing or upgrading the components involved in the production line, updating the softwares involved, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, It has been encountered that there are certain problems with CO2 dissolved or carbonation analysis. If you conduct further analysis on this variable as suggested, you will find that the carbonation values are very high (>15 gms per litre). Furthermore, there are 24.85% chances of getting high carbonation which may lead to higher spillage upon opening the bottle.</p>
<p>This issue needs to be addressed immediately. Understand that it could be a data issue as well since there were outliers registered in CO2 dissolved and therefore, we may need to collect other samples to conclude things later on.</p>
